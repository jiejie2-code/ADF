# Adaptive Dynamic Fusion of Multi-Modality Features for Enhanced Image Representation
we propose a novel model based on Vision Transformers and an adaptive feature fusion network. Our model comprises a multi-level feature decoupling layer that decouples global and modality-specific features, followed by an attention-based adaptive dynamic feature fusion strategy.
